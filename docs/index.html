<p>
Programmers wish to use high levels of abstraction and
generality in order to create programs that are readable, modular, reusable, portable
and maintainable. On the other hand it is often necessary to write programs that are efficient.
These two goals are often in conflict; abstraction usually adds overhead and reduces
the chances for optimization. Meanwhile the need for efficiency pulls the programmer
away from abstraction and promotes the use of platform and type specific optimizations.
</p>

<p>
Partial evaluation (PE) is a program transformation technique that uses a subset of
the inputs to a program to generate a specialized version of the program that will then
accept the rest of the inputs. With PE it is possible to write algorithms in a highly
general and abstracted form, and then automatically extract optimized versions of the
algorithm specialized for certain inputs.
</p>

<p>
Partial evaluation performs aggressive optimizations
by performing as much computation as possible based on the given inputs while
generating code that will perform the deferred computations. Several specialized
versions of a program section may be generated based upon different usages within
the program. An optimized program generated by a partial evaluator may be larger
in size than the original program, but will perform fewer computations at run-time.

Maple is a Computer Algebra System (CAS) and visualization environment. It uses
a high-level language, which is also called Maple, to perform symbolic and numeric
computations. Maple's core library contains a vast amount of mathematical knowledge
and problem solving power.

<p>
MapleMIX is a partial evaluator for the Maple programming language. It is a program
transformation and optimization tool for Maple programs. MapleMIX
is a completely online partial evaluator written in Maple itself. It has the ability
to produce highly specialized results from input programs and user provided static
data. It was developed with two goals in mind. Firstly to produce optimized code
by generating specialized versions of general algorithms.
And secondly to exploit the vast amount of mathematical knowledge present in the
Maple library by extracting precise answers
to parametric problems written to produce generic solutions.</p>
